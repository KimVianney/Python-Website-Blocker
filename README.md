# Python-Website-Blocker
This is a simple website blocker project implemented in python.
It uses a simple GUI using the tkinter python module and it works by modifying the hosts file in your main system directory,
by adding the blocked websites and redirecting them to local host.
To run the program efficiently, you need admin priviledges.
